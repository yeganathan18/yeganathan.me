### Long Story Short

I have built 2-3 portfolio websites in the past with plan of writing personal blogs regularly, but I failed.  

### Once again, But this time I will

In search of a good minimalistic design for my personal blog I found Andreas's portfolio. Luckily it was an open source project, so I created an independent fork of [chronark.com](https://chronark.com/) to adopt my own tastes.

Changes I made to the original project:

- Support for blog posts while maintaining the existing design style.
- Better SEO with built-in `robots.ts` and `sitemap.ts` of [Next.js 13](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/metadata)
- OG image generation for blog posts
- Depreciated project view counter but now reintroduced it for the blog post with same Upstash implementation.
- Minor UI changes that includes hovering effects, colors, tiny ui components, etc.
- Bumped up few packages@latest

If you have any suggestions for further improvements, I'd love to hear them. The original project can be found at [chronark/chronark.com](https://github.com/chronark/chronark.com).
