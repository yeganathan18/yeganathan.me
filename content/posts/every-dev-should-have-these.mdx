Hi there, 

Starting career as a software developer? Then this article is for you! Here I'm gonna discuss three main things that every developer should have. Being a developer myself, I found out how important they are. So let's start!

## LinkedIn

LinkedIn is one of the power tools which helps you connect with people, strengthen professional relationships and find the right job or internship. It provides a professional environment where people share their learnings, interview experiences, and many more. Even if you are not a developer, LinkedIn helps you connect with the people in your field of interest. You could connect with experts from top companies and ask your queries directly regarding the role, interview preparation, and more.

The main reason I joined LinkedIn was to make connections with talented professionals in my domain of interest. It's not just about creating an account on LinkedIn but optimizing the profile perfectly also matters. 

To make it simple, LinkedIn is another version of your resume. Sometimes while recruiters search for professionals, one might look into your profile, which could eventually lead to job opportunities.

## Github

**Github** is one of the core elements of every developer's life. For those who don't know about the platform, it's the place where ideas get crafted by builders, codes are stored/shared, and collaborations with other developers happen. Although there are quite a few platforms with the same beat, Github is still considered to be one of the most popular platforms in the developers' community.

It is a paradise for many developers. Most recruiters check our Github profile for our past projects as it shows the consistency and gradually working with tools & technologies. There are n-number of open-source projects to work on in Github. Same as in LinkedIn we can collaborate with other developers on Github, especially on open-source projects, and learn from them. Anyone who loves to code can contribute, so why wait? Start your contribution today.ðŸ› 

## Portfolio / Personal Website

Last but not least, every developer should have a portfolio that shows their skills and achievements. Your portfolio has to display that you're a technology expert and that you write good quality code. If you've worked on personal projects a lot and the technology you've used is relevant then you should include them in your portfolio.

It simply serves as proof of your accomplishments. By now, you may wonder, why have both Github and Portfolio when both more or less shows our skills? Well, in Github you show only your technical side whereas, in a portfolio, you could also add non-technical side achievements and a lot more about you.

I want to conclude that these, although the key elements are not the only requirements that a developer should fulfill. Just creating an account on LinkedIn or Github or making a simple portfolio doesn't make much impact, and that optimizing those matters equally. 

Hope this article helps you
