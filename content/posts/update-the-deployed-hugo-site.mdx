Hi there!
In the previous article, we were discussing how to create a portfolio with Hugo and deploying the same in Github pages. if you didn't check out yet, then do check out [here](https://dev.to/yeganathan18/create-and-deploy-your-hugo-site-52ek) and give it a read 😃

This blog is a continuation of the same and in this, I'm going to share how to update hugo site which has already been deployed.

For instance, let's say I need to add my previous article to the blog section of my portfolio and update the same in the deployed site.

Since we created 2 separate repos for our hugo site, we need to push commits of both the repositories ( `hugo_site` and `username.github.io` )

In order to start, we need to open our `hugo_site` directory in the terminal.

First, make sure all the commits in local and remote are the same. so let's pull those if there are any changes in the remote.
```sh
$ git fetch origin 
$ git rebase origin master
```
Now as usual open the files in the editor and shoot up the terminal and write the following commands in order to start our local server.

```sh
$ hugo server -D
```
Do the updates/changes and make sure everything is perfect.

Stop the server now and type the following commands in the terminal...
```sh
$ hugo
```
> This is to regenerate HTML files in our `username.github.io` submodule

After generating the HTML files, go to the `username.github.io` directory and push all the commits to the same.

```sh
$ cd <username.github.io>
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "committing the regenerated html files"
$ git push origin main
```
> the last command triggers Github to rebuild our page with the changes we've made.

Now again come back to the parent/previous directory and push all those commits to our `hugo_site` repository.

```sh
$ cd ..
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "committing the hugo changes and updated submodule"
$ git push origin master
```

⚠️ Note ⚠️
Make sure that you push files to the respective repos and branches.
```sh
error: src refspec master does not match any
```
> If you face any similar error like this then probably you should check the branching you're pushing.

#### Pro-Tips for faster page loads 🔫

1. Check [PageSpeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) always after deployment. 
2. Avoid using 4k resolution images or videos on your site. 
3. Try using Webp format for images rather than jpeg and png.

Hope this article helps you!

Happy coding 👨🏻‍💻
