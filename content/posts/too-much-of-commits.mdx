Hello Everyone! back with another topic, Have ever felt that your repository in Github has a lot of commits history in which few don't make sense? for example, fixing typos in the readme in my case. If you're a Beginner then you may think of creating a new repo and push all those pretty useless commits in a single commit message "First commit". Well, then you're in the right place. Actually, there is a way you can squash multiple commits into a single one.

**Basically, We squash commits to make our git log more concise.**

### Prerequisites:
* Git should be installed.
* Knowledge of Terminal and Git commands.

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è
Before experimenting with these, always have a backup of your files!

All being set let's dive into our topic! For easy understanding, I broke this into pieces and tried explaining in a noob way.

### Getting Started ü•≥

This is the commits history of my example repo.

<Image

  width="718"
  height="404"
  alt="Image" />

So in the above example, I don't want the 5 commits history which is in-between the last and first since it doesn't make sense. let's make those commits history into a single commit!

Shoot up the terminal and go to your repo folder directory

```sh
$ cd <repo-folder>
```

Make sure your repo folder is updated with all those commits you made and Write the following command...

```sh
$ git rebase -i HEAD~<n>
```

> In this case we are gonna give n as 6, where n is the number of commits history we need and these commits are from top-bottom. if we give n including the first commit we made, probably it shoots an error.

### Experimenting üß™
Executing the previous step will bring up the below interface with commit history and options to perform the following:

```sh
pick d8c1963 Adding contents
pick 5e4ea01 added
pick a3e1b06 removed few content
pick f9d4b67 Added few contents
pick 9e69811 Fixed typos and added content
pick 42dbace final

# Rebase 5f5302b..42dbace onto f9d4b67 (6 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick <commit> = use commit
# r, reword <commit> = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup <commit> = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec <command> = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# b, break = stop here (continue rebase later with 'git rebase --continue')
# d, drop <commit> = remove commit
# l, label <label> = label current HEAD with a name
# t, reset <label> = reset HEAD to a label
# m, merge [-C <commit> | -c <commit>] <label> [# <oneline>]
# .       create a merge commit using the original merge commit's
# .       message (or the oneline, if no original merge commit was
# .       specified). Use -c <commit> to reword the commit message.
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
```


### Squashing Begins‚ùóÔ∏è
Now, press <kbd>S</kbd> and it goes into editing mode. Replace **pick** as **squash**, for the commits you need to squash.
```sh
pick d8c1963 Adding contents
squash 5e4ea01 added
squash a3e1b06 removed few content
squash f9d4b67 Added few contents
squash 9e69811 Fixed typos and added content
pick 42dbace final

# Rebase 5f5302b..42dbace onto f9d4b67 (6 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick <commit> = use commit
# r, reword <commit> = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup <commit> = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec <command> = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# b, break = stop here (continue rebase later with 'git rebase --continue')
# d, drop <commit> = remove commit
# l, label <label> = label current HEAD with a name
# t, reset <label> = reset HEAD to a label
# m, merge [-C <commit> | -c <commit>] <label> [# <oneline>]
# .       create a merge commit using the original merge commit's
# .       message (or the oneline, if no original merge commit was
# .       specified). Use -c <commit> to reword the commit message.
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
-- INSERT --
```

> basically, all these 4 commits history is gonna be squashed into the previous one with a commit message which we are going to give in the next step. Always don't include **squash** in the first commit(Well! in this case, "d8c1963"), probably it shoots an error.

Now save the changes made by pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd> + <kbd>:</kbd> + <kbd>w</kbd> + <kbd>q</kbd> and after saving press <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>z</kbd> two times, which brings you to an interface like this... 

```sh
# This is a combination of 5 commits.
# This is the 1st commit message:

Adding contents
# This is the commit message #2:

added
# This is the commit message #3:

removed few content
# This is the commit message #4:

Added few contents
# This is the commit message #5:

Fixed typos and added content

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# Date:      Fri Dec 4 12:14:48 2020 +0530
#
# interactive rebase in progress; onto 5f5302b
"~/Dev-test-repo/.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG" 33L, 839C
```

> here what it does is 

### Processing üîÑ

Now it's our chance to delete the commit messages and create a new commit message

```sh
final test

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# Date:      Fri Dec 4 12:14:48 2020 +0530
#
# interactive rebase in progress; onto 5f5302b
# Last commands done (5 commands done):
#    squash f9d4b67 Added few contents
#    squash 9e69811 Fixed typos and added content
# Next command to do (1 remaining command):
#    pick 42dbace final
# You are currently rebasing branch 'main' on '5f5302b'.
#
# Changes to be committed:
#       modified:   README.md
```
Again, press <kbd>Esc</kbd> + <kbd>:</kbd> + <kbd>w</kbd> + <kbd>q</kbd> and after saving press <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>z</kbd> two times. Now you will be thrown out that environment.

### Takeoff ‚úàÔ∏è
All these efforts should be reflected in our repo right!? So, let's push all those to our example repo in Github...
```sh
$ git push -f
```

> here, we use **-f** since we're force pushing it.

### Finally üéâ

We squashed multiple commits to a single one!

For Beginners, remember deleting a commit is different from squashing commits.
