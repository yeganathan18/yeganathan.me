## Long Story Short

I have built 2-3 portfolio websites in the past with plan of writing personal blogs regularly, but I failed 😿

This time, coming back powerful than before 😎 and while in search of a good minimalistic design for my personal blog I found [chronark/chronark.com](https://github.com/chronark)

Luckily it was an open source project, so I created an independent fork of it to adopt my own tastes.

## New Changes

- [x] Support for blog posts while maintaining the existing design style.
- [x] Better SEO with built-in robots.ts and sitemap.ts of Next.js 13
- [x] OG image generation for blog posts
- [x] Depreciated project view counter but reintroduced it for the blog post with same Upstash implementation.
- [x] Minor UI changes that includes hovering effects, colors, tiny ui components, etc.
- [x] Bumped up few `packages@latest`
- [ ] Consolidate duplicated code and modularize for better organization and maintainability
- [ ] Fix the hydration errors
- [ ] Clean the code and unneccesary files
